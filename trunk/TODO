Major Feature:
1. Add EIP Tracing: Display which kernel module is invoking malicious operation.

2. Add Symbol Parsing: Convert the address[0X????????] to specific symbols such as NtOpenFile.
[Note] When i parse PE Files in the VMM, it sometimes causes the machine to freeze. I don't know why, maybe due to the page fault in VMM Mode.

3. Fix the protection area algorithm. Now it can work, but the area which is mapped(not the original one) would not be deleted after it is unmapped.

Minor Feature:
1. Own serial port receiver instead of GTKTerm. implement codes to supply the color display.

Future Feature:
1. DKOM Tracing.

2. Automatic analyze. Need to modify the code about the boot progress.
