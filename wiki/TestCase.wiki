#summary Using RKAnalyzer With Testcases

=Testcases=

Here I offer two testcases which can represent some popular techniques used in rootkits today. RKAnalyzer can detect these actions and show them to analyzers as understandable representations.

*Make sure you HAD Already set up the [http://code.google.com/p/rkanalyzer/wiki/Probes Probe] before test with rootkits*

===Case 1: SSDT Hooking===

Sample code is here: [http://code.google.com/p/rkanalyzer/source/browse/testcase/TestAccessSSDT/Main.cpp]

Checkout the TestAccessSSDT Directory and build under DDK. Load the driver, and you will see the following in serial Terminal:
http://rkanalyzer.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Screenshot-SSDT.png

Ignore other debug informations, just notice the area with red rectangle. The rookit's attempt to write the SSDT is intercepted and reported. RKAnalyzer can even show which entry of SSDT is being written, and the exact value the rootkit is going to assign.

===Case 2: MDL Attacking===

Sample code is here: [http://code.google.com/p/rkanalyzer/source/browse/testcase/SSDTMDL/Main.cpp]

MDL attack is much more dangerous than directly SSDT hooking, as the rootkit use another VA instead of the SSDT pointer exported by windows kernel, so it's hard to detect. RKAnalyzer can detect it.
